Our new long term venue is Cafe Rueben, 607 7th Avenue in Lewiston right next to the LCSC Normal Hill campus. Our \"session\" as it's traditionally called is a collection of musicians who play, or are interested in learning about, traditional Celtic and Old Timey music. Celtic refers to the music of Ireland, Scotland, England, and Wales, and Old Timey refers to music generally from the Appalachian mountains of the United States. There is a lot of crossover between these two traditions and we have good musical fun exploring them. We play jigs, reels, waltzes, polkas, breakdowns, songs, and sea shanties. If you play music from these traditions and would like to join us, please do so!  We are an open session and anyone who plays this type of music or who is interested in learning can sit in with us.
